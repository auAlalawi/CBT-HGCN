693456187036037123	1	42	3	35	49	@espn we could if the media would stop talking about it . ESPN , I challenge you to not bring up race again when talking about Super Bowl <end>
693456187036037123	1	43	3	35	53	@espn what ? ! @CameronNewton is #Black ? Aren't we talkin about race by saying not 2 talk about it ? Who makes these rules ? #letitgo #letitflow <end>

693456187036037123	1	47	3	35	62	@espn typical ! ! ! A black not wanting it to b a black thing . Yet it's a black making it a black thing . @CharlesBarkIey that's sad . SMH <end>
693456187036037123	1	48	3	35	65	@espn I hope it doesn't come down to race at all . Can Newton is just a great qb . He got where he's at with talent and hard work and high IQ . <end>

693456187036037123	1	50	3	35	69	@espn it was never once about race . All the Black people who make an effort to point out race are directly segregating blacks an whites . <end>
693456187036037123	1	51	3	35	73	@espn it is sad - can is a great athlete - they create problems - Juan , Al , Jesse , Geraldo - then Cam believes it <end>
693456187036037123	1	52	3	35	84	@espn It's only about a black QB because Cam is making it that way . The last three Super Bowls have featured black QBs . <end>

693456187036037123	1	55	3	35	102	@espn As far as I can tell , Cam is the one making it about race . Everyone else I have heard hasn't mentioned it . <end>

693456187036037123	1	67	3	35	197	@espn good QB that had a great year . Great QBs do so year after year - his coronation as a great QB is pending <end>
693456187036037123	1	68	3	35	205	@espn quit reposting that if you don't want his race brought up . Cam is a great player . Period . No further comments needed . <end>
693456187036037123	1	69	3	35	211	@espn tell that to Cam . He is happy to use race card <end>

724348906096590849	1	37	6	36	23	@FoxNews @Target I believe it's time we start building a third gender bathroom policy . Each for Male / female / others ( transgenders ) . <end>
724348906096590849	1	38	6	36	23	@FoxNews I have a better idea . Men should use women's room and women use men's room at target <end>
724348906096590849	1	39	6	36	23	@FoxNews @Target that's more people than there are transgender . <end>
